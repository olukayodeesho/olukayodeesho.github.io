I'm a technnical lead and senior software engineer with strong interest in distributed systems, banking/payment platforms, cloud services, and applied AI.

I enjoy building reliable automation, microservices, integration systems, developer tooling, and scalable backend services across .NET, Java, and Ruby ecosystems.
